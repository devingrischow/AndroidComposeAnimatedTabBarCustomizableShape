# Android Compose Animated Nav Bar with Varied Customizable Indent Shape

This is a Navigation Tab Bar with a customizable animated indent shape made in and designed for Android Jetpack Compose. 

The intent of this nav tab bar is to allow for the shape of the indent to be highly customizable and animatable, allowing for the shape animation values to be modified and changed at different points and conditions on the nav bar.

This allows for highly customizable nav bars with releatively low effort to implement, with detailed information and explanations throughout the code.
