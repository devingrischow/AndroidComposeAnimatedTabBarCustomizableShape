# Android Compose Animated Tab Bar with Customizable Indent Shape

This is a Navigation Tab Bar with a customizable animated indent shape made in and designed for Android Jetpack Compose. 

The intent of this navigation tab bar is to allow for the shape of the indent to be highly customizable and animatable, by allowing for the shape values to be modified and changed during app running depending on given values or conditions. 

This allows for highly customizable tab bars with releatively low effort to implement, with detailed information throughout the code.
